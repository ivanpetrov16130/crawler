# crawler

Just primitive web-crawler, which helps you to get all the "usable" urls from some pages.

## Installation

WTF is installation? I'm noob, download it yourself and compile!

## Usage

Lol, run it in lein and open your found urls recorded in file("out__urls.txt").
And add your urls to file "urls.txt" for crawling, before you start.

    $ cd MyWayToClojureProjects/crawler
    $ lein run depth

## Options

--depth

How many times crawler should process bunches of urls? That's it - a number of waves!

## Examples

1)Add to file "urls.txt" "http://www.exmaple.com", save file.

2)
    $ cd  MyWayToClojureProjects/crawler

3)
    $ lein run 3

4) Open file "out__urls"

5) ????

6) PROFIT!!!!

### Bugs

 ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
